Here is a short description of the new organisation :

- server
- player
- common for files that are shared by server and player
- misc for files that do not enter first three folders

Those 4 folders share the same organisation :

- customer for specifics customer files (it can include specific sources, doc, scripts, tools...)
- doc for documentation 
- tools
- sources for code

NB, all folder names should share the following naming convention : 
- lower case with underscore to separate word.
- for player, folders in source must have the same name like the binary generated file
- libraries start with tc_  (exe files can also start with tc_ when they could be mismatched with OS commands)
